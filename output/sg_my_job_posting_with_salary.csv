Access CSIRO’s world-class facilities and resources while completing your PhD
Apply for a CSIRO-WSU PhD Scholarship now!

CSIRO Agriculture and Food and Western Sydney University (WSU) are offering a joint scholarship to a PhD candidate who has undertaken studies in agricultural science and plant biology. The student will work within a research team investigating genetics and physiology of sodicity tolerance in cotton.

Cotton is one of the most valuable agricultural commodities in Australia. The Australian cotton industry is known for high productivity and economic return, and has significantly contributed to the viability of many rural communities. Increasing cotton sodicity tolerance is of importance as much of Australia’s cotton is grown in sodic soils with a very high clay content and high pH. In such soils, excessive Na can impair cotton nutrient uptake and use, cause nutrient related stresses and reduce nutrient use efficiency. Consequently, limiting cotton productivity.

CSIRO cotton breeders have made significant progress identifying a leaf Na+ exclusion trait in cultivated tetraploid cotton species which has been bred into elite CSIRO germplasm and has potential to improve cotton sodicity tolerance. This project will investigate the inheritance and physiological mechanism of this trait and look at molecular markers applicable to its future fast-track breeding in cotton. The outcomes of this project will include new rapid screening tools for identifying and developing sodicity tolerant cotton, and new understanding on mechanisms of cotton sodicity tolerance.

During this project some of the tasks the student may undertake include:

Planning, preparing and conducting field, laboratory and glasshouse experiments at both CSIRO and WSU facilities.
Applying innovative approaches to testing and developing new cost-effective screening protocols for cotton tolerance to soil sodicitiy.
Collecting, processing and analysing plant materials, and undertaking phenotyping and genotyping in different experiments.
Collating, analysing and interpreting data using appropriate computer programs.

Location: Myall Vale (Narrabri), NSW

Scholarship: AU$30,000 per year (stipend)

Plus Research Training Program (RTP) Fee Offset through Western Sydney University (WSU) and support for conference attendance, fieldwork and additional costs as approved by CSIRO and School of Science and Health, WSU.

Tenure: (Up to) 3 year term (concordant with PhD at WSU)

Orygen is the world’s leading research and knowledge translation organisation focusing on mental ill-health in young people.

At Orygen, our leadership and staff work to deliver cutting-edge research, policy development, innovative clinical services, and evidence-based training and education to ensure that there is continuous improvement in the treatments and care provided to young people experiencing mental ill-health.

The Company has three Members: the Colonial Foundation, The University of Melbourne and Melbourne Health.

The University of Melbourne has an agreement with Orygen for designated employees to be made available to undertake activities for Orygen, and this arrangement will apply to you. University employees working at Orygen are required at all times to continue to adhere to University policies, procedures, regulations and statutes, as well as to Orygen policies and procedures (including Orygen’s delegations of authority framework which can be found at http://staff.orygen.org.au/), but the University’s policies and procedures shall prevail in the event of any inconsistency. For the period of participating in activities at Orygen, you will be subject to the reasonable control and direction of Orygen. You consent to the University disclosing to Orygen your personal employment information solely for the purposes of facilitating your secondment to Orygen, and that such disclosure will not be a breach of any of your privacy rights.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is Australia’s third most costly mental disorder. It starts in adolescence and emerging adulthood, but treatment typically occurs late when problems in interpersonal relationships, education and employment are entrenched. Despite frequently seeking help, people with BPD are as likely to die from suicide as those with schizophrenia. The Helping Young People Early (HYPE) program has pioneered the field of prevention and early intervention for BPD in young people. Our research program aims to address two key questions: (i) How can we accurately define personality disorder characteristics in young people? (ii) How can we understand the cause and development of BPD to help prevention and early intervention?

We seek a Research Assistant to work on a randomised controlled trial (‘VERBATIM’) investigating whether a second-generation antipsychotic (aripiprazole) can reduce the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations in young people with BPD. Participants will be young people (aged 15 to 25 years) attending specialist clinical services at Orygen.

The Research Assistant will be required to display self-initiative and work productively within the research and clinical teams using established protocols. The Research Assistant will also be required to keep meticulous records and maintain data, assisting with data entry and verification.

The Research Assistant will report to, and work under the direction of the Trial Coordinator and Principal Investigator, who reports to the Head, Centre for Youth Mental Health.

To ensure the University provides a safe environment for children, this position requires the incumbent to hold a current and valid Working with Children Check.

Organisational Environment
The Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Innovations in Peptide and Protein Science (CIPPS) is a nationally funded research centre headquartered at The University of Queensland (UQ). The Centre is a consortium of six Australian universities, led by UQ, with nodes at The University of Sydney, The Australian National University, Monash University, Queensland University of Technology, and Edith Cowan University, and includes several leading domestic and international partner institutions.

Funded through a seven-year $35M grant and an additional $54M in cash and in-kind contributions from the Centre’s national and international partners, the Centre aims to unleash the potential of peptides and proteins for human benefit. Peptides and proteins are the working molecules of life and understanding their structures and functions will allow Centre researchers and their partners to apply them in applications in fundamental science, agriculture, medicine and biotechnology. Our capacity-building programs are training a new generation of scientists in cutting-edge fundamental research, innovation, and entrepreneurialism.

The three key research themes of the Centre are to:

Discover novel peptides and proteins from Australian flora and fauna;
Decode the functions of these peptides and proteins;
Develop translated outcomes based on the knowledge generated from the Discover and Decode themes.

The Centre has 14 Chief Investigators, 8 international Partner Investigators, and 51 international and domestic Associate Investigators spanning fifteen (15) Australian universities and research institutes and twenty-nine (29) national and international research partners.
